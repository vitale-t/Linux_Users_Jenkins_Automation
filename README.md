# Linux_Users_Jenkins_Automation

Jenkins pipeline that allows you to create users on Unix systems, generate a temporary password assigned to the user (which the end user must change upon initial login), and retrieve it for copying and emailing.

Note: Illustrative model. Does not incorporate good security practices. Requires additional permits, which are subject to consideration. You must have access to a Jenkins instance with permissions to create and run pipelines.
